#Project description
The libLAS project is a C/C++ library for reading and writing LiDAR data in the ASPRS LAS formats 1.0/1.1/1.2 into your own C/C++ appplications and suite of command-line utilities for inspecting, manipulating, transforming, and processing LAS LiDAR data. Newer LAS formats are not yet supported (from FAQ)
Inital development was by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources for use in its state-wide LiDAR project, ongoing support is provided by various organizations including the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, however since 2014 the libLAS project has been mostly superceded by Martin Isenburg's LASlib library.  
The libLAS website goes on to say the 'only fuctionality that libLAS provides over LASlib is the ability to work with GDAL-derived coordinate system information and reproject into infrequently-used coordinate systems." And additionally recommends that that if interested in manipulating LAS data mainly in Python, the pure-Python laspy library is more suited than the libLAS library's Python capabilities.

#Bug reporting, feature requests, and questions
Bug reporting is easily accessed through a link to the libLAS github repository where users can click on the "new issue" button to open an issue and contact the libLAS maintainers and community.  New feature requests seem less likely to be handled as the library is in maintainance mode currently, with only a relatively small number contributions each year since 2012.
The libLAS community can be contacted through two mailing lists:
*http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/liblas-devel
*http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/liblas-commits
And project developers can be contacted on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) on#liblas on Freenode
#Comercial support
Unknown if there are any besides Hobu, a group of three software engineerss which I found by following the link of one of authors listed as a libLAS developer at the end of the Development section of the website.  The link to commercial and open source software and organizations using libLAS was broken, and throughout the project description users are recommended to use LAStools for LAS processing and if working in an academic or non-comercial setting.  LAStools is the commercial support alternative for LAS data.
#Latest source code availability
The main repository for libLAS is on github at https://github.com/libLAS/libLAS
and a copy of the active code can obtained with:
git clone git://github.com/libLAS/libLAS.git liblas
Currently the source code cannot be viewed online without using git clone process.
#Information for contributing to the project
Not clear from information I could find, given the dormant status of the project however four of the five members of the libLAS development team have linkes to their contact information.
#Project status
libLAS is in a self described "dormant period" of development and is mainly maintained only in its current form.  Developeers are advised to build atop LASlib if starting a new development.
